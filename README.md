# Web-scraping

Hi John!

I have 3 problems with my codes:

1. It still scraps the 3 Sponsored books at the top (which are not really part of my request)

2. I can not manage to scrape the Best Selling Rank (as a comment in my code), the screen shot I sent you through Twitter yesterday.

3. I am getting blocked by amazon very quickly, even using agents and time... any idea what I could do to be able to scrape all pages ?

Excuse the heavyness of my code! I am a newbie!!

Thanks a bunch!
